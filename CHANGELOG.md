# Changelog

All notable changes to CarWash will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-30

Improve codebase: refactor monolithic files
Improve UX: add settings 

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-30

Removed Cargo.lock from .gitignore - thanks to [0323pin](https://github.com/0323pin)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### üéØ Major Improvements

**Cache Persistence System**
- Implemented robust cross-platform dependency cache using project directories
- Cache keys based on Cargo.lock hash for automatic invalidation on dependency changes
- Intelligent 5-minute cache duration with proper timestamp preservation
- Separate cache files per project to prevent cross-contamination
- Debug logging system for cache operations (writes to /tmp/carwash-debug.log)

**Background Update Intelligence**
- Failed dependency checks now automatically retry on next startup
- Queue logic checks ALL dependencies, not just first one, before deciding to skip
- Projects with ANY uncached/expired dependencies now auto-queue for background checking
- Conditional status updates: only shows "Checking" when actually performing network requests
- Prevents status flickering when loading from cache

**View Synchronization**
- Fixed race condition where explorer tree showed "checking" while dependency pane showed cached results
- All three views (explorer, wizard, dependency pane) now update simultaneously
- Background check results no longer interfere with wizard display when locked to specific project
- Proper project locking prevents stale data from affecting open wizards

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Refactoring

**Code Organization**
- Extracted 364-line monolithic reducer into focused handler functions in new `src/handlers.rs`
- 25+ specialized handler functions for clean separation of concerns
- Reducer simplified to pure action dispatch layer
- Improved code maintainability and testability

**Error Handling**
- Replaced generic `Box<dyn Error>` with `anyhow` for better error context in cache operations
- Added comprehensive error messages with file paths and operation context
- Better debugging with detailed error propagation

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

**Cache Timestamp Issues**
- Fixed cache.rs resetting timestamps to "now" on load (prevented cache expiry logic from working)
- Fixed runner.rs using quit time instead of actual check time when saving cache
- Fixed main.rs saving cache with current time instead of preserving dep.last_checked

**Race Conditions**
- Fixed UpdateDependenciesStreamStart arriving after UpdateDependencies (cache hit scenario)
- Fixed wizard update nested inside conditional that could fail silently
- Fixed background updates overwriting wizard display for locked project
- Fixed user_check_in_progress flag being set too late, causing premature flag clearing

**Queue and Status Management**
- Fixed background queue only checking first dependency instead of all dependencies
- Fixed status always being set to "Checking" even when all deps were cached
- Fixed duplicate cache loading on startup (now loads once correctly)

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

**Update Wizard**
- Wizard now locks to selected project, preventing background updates from changing display
- Shows correct project name in wizard title
- Wizard populates with current dependency data immediately on open
- No more "checking for updates" spinner when data is already cached

**Status Indicators**
- Project status accurately reflects cache state
- No more 20-second "checking" delay when data is already cached
- Background checks for failed dependencies happen invisibly
- Status updates are instant when loading from cache

### üß™ Testing & Quality

**Development Experience**
- Comprehensive debug logging to /tmp/carwash-debug.log
- Cache operations log project names, dep counts, lock hashes, and success/failure
- Load operations show cache hits/misses and hash mismatches
- All 34 tests passing
- Clippy clean with no warnings

### üìù Technical Details

**Cache Format**
```json
{
  "lock_file_hash": 12345,
  "dependencies": {
    "serde": {
      "latest_version": "1.0.210",
      "cached_at": <SystemTime>
    }
  }
}
```

**Cache Invalidation**
- Automatic when Cargo.lock changes (hash mismatch)
- Manual via age (> 5 minutes old)
- Failed checks not cached (prevents caching errors)

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

None. Fully backward compatible.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-25

### ‚ú® Features

**Background Update System**
- Automatic background update checking on startup for all projects
- Non-blocking background checks process up to 5 projects concurrently
- Background update queue system with parallelization limiting

**Priority Update Queueing**
- User-initiated update checks (pressing 'u') now jump to the front of the queue
- Ensures responsive behavior when manually requesting updates
- Background checks continue processing in parallel

**UI Refresh After Updates**
- After successful `cargo update`, dependency versions are immediately refreshed
- UI now displays new versions from crates.io without manual rechecking
- Fresh cache-busting check performed after each update completes

### üéÆ Navigation Improvements

**Separated Navigation Contexts**
- **Tab Navigation**: Now uses `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` instead of left/right arrows
  - `Tab`: Move to next output tab (with wraparound)
  - `Shift+Tab`: Move to previous output tab (with wraparound)
- **Workspace Navigation**: Left/right arrows and h/l now dedicated to workspace operations
  - `‚Üê` or `h`: Collapse selected workspace
  - `‚Üí` or `l`: Expand selected workspace
- Eliminates conflicting dual-purpose keybindings
- Clearer, more intuitive navigation model

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed UI not updating with new dependency versions after successful updates
- Resolved navigation conflicts between tab switching and workspace collapse/expand
- Improved queue processing to prevent race conditions in background checks

### üìö Documentation

- Updated help screen with new `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` tab navigation keys
- Updated keyboard shortcuts to clarify workspace vs tab navigation
- Added documentation for background update queue system
